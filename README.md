This is my optimal Vim config. For more info, see the commented lines at the beginning of the *vimrc* file.
## Installation
If you're using Linux/Mac and you have git installed, run the *installer.sh*. It will install Vundle for you and **overwrites** your vim config with this one. If you're not using Windows, manually install Vundle and replace your vimrc file with the one in this repo.

## Colorscheme
This config uses [vim-orbital](github.com/fcpg/vim-orbital) colorscheme. The colors are as follows:
|         ||
|-------|--------|
|#000000|#262626|
|#5f5f5f|#949494|
|#bcbcbc|#e4e4e4|
|#ffd7af|#d7af87|
|#af875f|#5f87d7|
|#5f87af|#87afd7|
|#5fafff|#0087d7|
|#005faf|#0000d7|
